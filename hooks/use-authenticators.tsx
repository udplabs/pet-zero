/**
 * useAuthenticators
 *
 * Hook responsibilities:
 * 1. Conditionally fetch the current user's enrolled authentication factors (MFA authenticators) via SWR.
 * 2. Provide an optimistic deletion UX with a timed UNDO:
 *    - Immediately removes the authenticator from the local cache.
 *    - Shows a toast with a countdown-driven Undo button.
 *    - If not undone within N seconds, executes the DELETE request.
 *    - If the DELETE fails (or Undo chosen), restores the original cache snapshot.
 *
 * Data Flow:
 * - SWR key is only activated once we know (a) user.sub OR (b) auth loading finished (prevents premature call).
 * - deleteAuthenticator(authenticatorId):
 *    a) Take snapshot of current list.
 *    b) Optimistically filter it out (mutate(..., revalidate:false)).
 *    c) Spawn toast with CountDownButton (Undo).
 *    d) On dismiss / countdown completion â†’ perform actual DELETE.
 *    e) On failure â†’ revert snapshot + surface error toast.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - Network / server errors are wrapped in APIError for consistent JSON shape.
 * - Undo path cancels the pending destructive effect by restoring snapshot (no revalidate).
 *
 * UX Notes:
 * - Countdown button both displays remaining time and triggers finalization when it completes.
 * - Undo dismisses the toast and short-circuits the DELETE request (since fetch is only fired at onDismiss/onComplete).
 *
 * Potential Improvements:
 * - Add AbortController usage to actually abort an in-flight DELETE if Undo clicked after it started (currently controller defined but not tied to an abort action on undo).
 * - Debounce rapid successive deletions.
 * - Revalidate after successful DELETE to ensure server truth (small risk of drift if other tabs modify factors).
 * - Track pending deletes to disable duplicate clicks.
